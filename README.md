# Pangle iOS SDK
Pangle iOS SDK for Swift Package Manager.

# Integration
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.
To integrate the Pangle SDK into your project using Swift Package Manager:
1. Add it to the dependencies of your Package.swift:
```objc
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/bytedance/AdsGlobalPackage", .exact("5.3.0-beta.9"))
    ]
```
2. Enable the `-ObjC` flag in Xcode: select Build Settings, search for Other Linker Flags and add `-ObjC`.
